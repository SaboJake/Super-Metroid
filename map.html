			<h3>Crateria</h3>

			<h3>Brinstar</h3>
			<p>Returning from the original Metroid, Brinstar has changed a bit from your last visit. From Brinstar you can get to: Crateria, Norfair and Maridia.Brinstar is devided in smaller regions: Blue Brinstar, Green Brinstar and Red Brinstar. Here you will find your first upgrades. Major upgrades that are found here: Morph Ball, first Missile Tank, first Super Missile Tank, Charge Beam, Spazer Beam, Varia Suit, first Power Bomb Tank(dev intended), X-Ray Scope.</p>
			<p>How to get to Maridia: while exploring you will find a glass tube, and if you check your map you will see that you are in a new area, Maridia. Use a Power Bomb to break open the glass.</p>
